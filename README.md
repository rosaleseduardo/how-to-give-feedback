# General Knowledge

- Review the difference between what we can observe about people and what we cannot, because it is like the part of the iceberg that is hidden under water.
- Review the danger of assuming things.
- It is essential to keep in mind that, to grow, you must not only be willing to receive feedback but you must also seek it.

# The iceberg: what should we focus the feedback on?

The first element that you have to take into account makes reference to the so-called Feedback Iceberg which is composed of three levels:

1. Behaviours
2. Attitudes
3. Perceptions
4. Values

it is important to consider that when you are given feedback, this is much more assimilable, understandable when it is about observed behaviours. This without leaving aside that everything you see from a person is just what is above the line of water, you just can see what they do, their behaviours. When you give feedback about behaviours, you could attempt to improve them but, without compromising attitudes, beliefs, the most inner characteristics of a person. However, when we give feedback about the "doings", we could change the behaviours.

# The 5 principles of feedback

A feedback is not necessarily a performance assesmement, the principles of feedback we touch are associated the the feedback model:

1. For appreciation
2. For performance assesmement
3. For coaching

in all of them the following elements must be present:

- Positive feedback is given in public, negative feedback privately
- Be empathic
- Never give feedback angry
- Do not lie to avoid hurting
- Instead of just working on weaknesses, reinforce the strenghts

We'll tell you what are the elements that make a feedback to be considered as _"good"_:

- **Specific and concrete**: You must give examples, mention times and the impact it had
- **Timely**: Delivered as soon as possible at the time the events occurred
- **Balanced**: Positive and negative feedback can be given at the same time.

A culture should be promoted where feedback is valued. One way to do this is by thanking them every time they give us feedback.

# How to structure the feedback

Now it's the time to construct your speech to give feedback. We'll use the following equation

```text
SITUATION  + BEHAVIOUR + IMPACT
```

The way you should use the formula would be: "When I saw SITUATION, your BEHAVIOUR made me feel THIS WAY, causing IMPACT. I believe we could be more effective if we we something different (ALTERNATIVE). What do you think about this?"

The usage of the previous formula would serve to take off the journey, not without forgetting to be always assertive with our words.

I would like to provide you with an example of how feedback should be given appropriately:

"I've noticed that you haven't been sharing information with the design team and haven't been inviting them to our weekly meetings. They are looking for information, and you are not sharing insights you've come across related to their work. In some meetings, when they express this concern, I've observed that you become defensive and don't take actions to address it. This impacts the quality of work for both teams. What are your thoughts on this?"
